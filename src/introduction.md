# The Unofficial Bevy Rendering Book

This book is designed to act as a useful learning and reference tool for Bevy's rendering engine. A general knowledge of Bevy is required to affectively understand this book.
It also will help to have a general knowledge of how rendering works in general.

## Goal
To provide bevy users with the knowledge in order to build their own Bevy rendering plugins.

## Additional Resources
- Bevy's rendering design is somewhat inspired by the 2015 GDC talk "[Destiny's Multithreaded Rendering Architecture](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/destiny/gdc_2015/Tatarchuk_GDC_2015__Destiny_Renderer_web.pdf)".
- Although not required learning WGPU as a first step can help in understanding how modern rendering API's work: [https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/)
- Understanding linear algebra can also help quite a bit: [http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html)
- Finally this vulkan tutorial is quite helpful: [https://vulkan-tutorial.com/](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) but a bit more complex comparatively to WGPU and bevy.
